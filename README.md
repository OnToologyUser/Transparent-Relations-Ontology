# Transparent Relations Ontology

## About

Transparent Relations Ontology (TRO) offers a vocabulary to publish information about relations that should be more transparent, usually between powerful parties, to detect potential conflicts of interests: for example, governments and their providers, or politicians and their personal relationships. Research journalism and Open Data are two areas in which this sort of data is growing, and new methods and standards are needed to cope with the ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)) publication and consumption of such data.

TRO provides the vocabulary for the following projects:

* [Basque Country Institutions Transparent Relations Graph](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/BasqueCountryInstitutionsTransparentRelationsGraph).
* [Jon Ander Asua Gradu Amaierako Lana: KG Relaciones Clientelares](https://github.com/JonAnderAsua/TFG-KG-RelacionesClientelares).

## HTTP Access

TRO has a persistent URI thanks to [W3ID](https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/tree/master/TRO):

## Best practices

Feel free to contribute in any way, with pull requests, issues, etc. We try to follow the best practices from [Best Practices for Implementing FAIR Vocabularies and Ontologies on the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13084) and other resources as described in the guidelines bellow.

### Development

We loosely stick to [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) so basically:

* Work on a `feature_*` branch listing the changes in the `RELEASES.md` file under the section `## Changes (No release yet)`.
* When are you are done merge `feature_*` into `develop`, preferably with a pull request.
* To create a release after major changes:
  * Change the `owl:priorVersion` to the current version; `owl:versionInfo`, `owl:versionIRI` and `owl:schemaVersion` values to the version that will be released.
  * Make sure all [ROBOT tests pass](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/Transparent-Relations-Ontology/actions) (See "Ontology quality" section bellow).
  * Create the documentation (See "Documentation" section bellow).
  * Merge from `develop` to a new `release_*` branch and edit the `RELEASES.md` file changing `## Changes (No release yet)` to the release number (e.g. `## RELEASE 0.1.2`) and adding any new changes to the list that were made in the `develop` branch.
* Merge `release_*` to `main` (With a pull request), `gh-pages` and `develop`.
* If a major version bump has happened, create both a release and a tag in GitHub pointing to the commit in `main` resulting from pulling `release_*`.

### Ontology quality

The main [OWL](ontology) file in [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) lives at `development/TransparentRelationsOntology.ttl`, and it is produced using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/). 

The quality is checked by executing different [ROBOT](https://github.com/ontodev/robot) processes that are defined in a Makefile (`robot/Makefile`):

* [Report](http://robot.obolibrary.org/report#report-level-error): this is based on [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) [queries](http://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/) that are collected in an specific profile (`robot/tro_report_profile`) with their respective log level (Error, Warn, Info). New queries can be defined as per [ROBOT instructions](http://robot.obolibrary.org/report#profiles). To execute locally (Specially to see the HTML report generated), run `make report`.
* [Reason](http://robot.obolibrary.org/reason) applies automatic inference to the ontology, which is used in this case to simply ensure the ontology is consistent. To execute locally, run `make reason`.

A [GitHub actions](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/Transparent-Relations-Ontology/actions) workflow checks the quality after every push or pull request to `develop` as defined in the GitHub Actions YAML file: `.github/workflows/robot.yml`.

### Documentation

The documentation is generated by the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) version of [Widoco](https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/). Execute `widoco.sh`: it will take `development/TransparentRelationsOntology.ttl` as input and it will generate the HTML files in `release/`.
